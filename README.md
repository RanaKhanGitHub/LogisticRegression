# LogisticRegression

# Mr. John Hughes would like you to create a Logistical Regression model and associated ROC/AUC curve for his cancer.csv dataset in order to predict if the patient has cancer based the following variables:

#Independent Variables
ID - ID number
Clump Thickness - 1-10
UofCSize - Uniformity of Cell Size 1-10 UofShape - Uniformity of Cell Shape 1-10 Marginal Adhesion - 1-10
SECSize - Single Epithelial Cell Size 1-10 Bare Nuclei - 1-10
Bland Chromatin - 1-10
Normal Nucleoli - 1-10
Mitoses - 1-10

#Dependent Variable
Class - Benign (i.e. No Cancer) - 2, Malignant (i.e. Cancer) - 4
Note: ID will not be used and will need to be dropped prior to building your model.


#The Ask:
Rational Statement (summary of the problem or problems to be addressed by the PPT)
Present the Learning Curve for the Logistical Regression standard model and identify two (2) insights
Present and Explain three (3) key insights from the classification report metrics (i.e. Precision, Recall, F1) for the Optimized Logistical Regression Model
Present and Explain two (2) key insights from ROC/AUC Curve (Optimized Model)
State and explain two (2) recommendations for Mr. John Hughes for next steps
